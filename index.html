                    <h3>WHO IS ANAMIKA?</h3>
                    <p>Well to begin with, she is a human. Great human being, one of the best. She is quirky and will make you laugh with her 
                        almost-bold, not-so-mature and childish acts. She is cheerful kind-hearted (those types who cry in theatres over smallest  of emotional scenes). The latter will actually make you love her more. She claims she has best facial features and rightly so. And an almost double chin (sorry Anamika). She weighs 60 KG last time i peeked into the machine. She is confident, expressive and sports a kick ass attitude that can shut the mouth of an 18 year experienced interviewer (she has only one). Now i guess thats enough for you to kinda make a mind picture of her.</p><br/>
                    <p> I almost forgot to mention. She is unexpectingly great <a href="https://behance.net/anamika_raj">UX Designer</a> too.</p>

                    <p>You shan't actually, since it doesn't concern you. It's a tribute as i told you to let her know (failingly), how much important she is. This is a small effort from me. I hope she likes it.</p>

I did this and i didnt know any other way, to tell her, how much important she is in my life and how much i love and respect her. I know this doesnt even account for anything, but i seriously dont know how else to tell her what importance she holds in my life.</p>
